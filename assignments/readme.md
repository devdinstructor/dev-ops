# Why the?!
The assignment process is tailored to make you apply all that you've learnt during this course. You may consider much of it, a reflection of what you would go through during your work stint.

# Anyway,

## This is important!
1. Each student must, configure their repository username and email address to match the college records. Psst! We went through this during the class! 

## This one too.
1. Each student must, under the assignments directory,  create a directory with the same name as their USN. e.g.,
</br>
    ```
    ~/assignments/4NI19IS007_A
    ```
    I've done it for Bond. Just follow the lead.

2. Each student must, name their assignment as follows
    ```
        Assignment_1, Assignment_2, .., and so on.
    ```
    This is critical for evaluation.

2. Each student must, submit their assignment to their respective assignment directory created in step #1.

3. Each student must, submit their assignment as a pull-request to this repository.

4. Each pull-request will be, reviewed, evaluated, approved, and merged to the repository either by me or a faculty. 

5. No student must, merge their, or a fellow student's pull-request. 

6. Each student must, ensure that their pull-request (assignment) is reviewed, approved, and merged by a faculty, and not by a fellow student. 

## Super important!
1. Each student must, submit all their assignments, on or before **16th December 2022**.
